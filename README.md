# improvedObjectClassForBlender
improves default blender object class to account for 2 new properties to add Hyper-Links

This add-On for Blender was created so that I can add properties to a default Blender Object. I need this in order to
store Hyper-Links in those properties, and those hyperlinks I use for fast access to files with one click.
